###### This is our prototype to make truck journey easy for all the truck drivers along the world.
* Team Name:  BugBytes
* Theme: Better Navigation System 
* College Name:  MKSSS’s Cummins College Of Engineering for Women, Pune
* Challenge: How can TomTom help truck drivers be safer, happier and more effective in their daily deliveries?
* Title:  KNOW YOUR TRIP
* Overview of the statement:<br/>
Propose a trip that considers a driver’s rest hours and gives suggestions on rest locations along the way.

* Solution we proposed:</br>
We have created a prototype which truck drivers can use. The driver needs to go through the following steps:<br/>
1. Search for his departure location. A marker will be displayed.
2. Search for the arrival location. A marker will be displayed.
3. It will then show the best route he/she can take to have a good journey.
4. The total time of travel and the total distance to be covered will be displayed.
5. It will then show the total rest hours of the journey and the number of days it will take for the delivery.

* Why is it needed: </br>
Considering the current situation, truck accidents are still very common. Even though the transport convenience has improved, truck accidents still prevail. It is not only hazardous for the truck drivers, but also for other travelers along the way. Most of the truck accidents are either because of lack of attention or fatigue. Drowsy driving has become a major problem. It is important that truck drivers have proper rest along the way, and get instructions for a safe and efficient journey.
Our solution provides a trip route that is convenient by all means. It suggests rest hours for the drivers in their entire journey. This will be based on the total travel time and also on the amount of hours he/she can drive at a stretch. </br>

 


* Technologies Used: <br/>

* Future Scope: 

This is a very simple idea, but can always be improvised. </br>
1. The prototype can be used to prompt the driver about the rest locations available all along the way. 
2. Based on the real time traffic data, the driver is prompted to rest when the traffic is high and continue the journey when traffic is low, which will shorten the delivery time.
3. In case multiple drivers driving the same truck, the data of each driver will be considered and merged through separate logins. This can result in even faster deliveries.
4. The route to be taken can be made economically feasible taking into account the fuel requirements based on speed and other data.
