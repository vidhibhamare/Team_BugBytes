* Team Name:  BugBytes
* College Name:  MKSSSâ€™s Cummins College Of Engineering for Women, Pune
* Challenge: How can TomTom help truck drivers be safer, happier and more effective in their daily deliveries?
* Title:  KNOW YOUR TRIP
* Description of the Solution:<br/>
Truck drivers need to have a proper rest periods along their journey. Considering the current scenario, we see that a majority of road accidents are because of a lack of alertness by drivers. It is hazardous for other people traveling along the way too. We decided to improvise the journey of the truck drivers by taking into consideration their daily rest hours. Having lack of sleep could lead the driver to be unalert and that could be a major reason of accidents,taking that into account, we are trying to showcase the rest hours, so that it won't be allowed for the driver to take journey unless he has taken some rests in advance.
